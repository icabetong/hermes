This is a simple web application for tracking medicine inventory for a small pharmacy. The application is built using Vue 3, TypeScript, and TailwindCSS.

The application allows users to add, update, and delete medicine items from their inventory. Each medicine item can have a name, description, quantity, price, and expiry date. Users can search for medicines by name, view details about individual medicines, and sort the inventory by various attributes.

The UI is designed using TailwindCSS, making it responsive and visually appealing. The application is built using TypeScript, which provides type checking and helps catch errors before runtime. Vue 3 provides reactive data bindings and efficient rendering, making the application fast and responsive.

## Recommended IDE Setup

[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) (and disable Vetur) + [TypeScript Vue Plugin (Volar)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.vscode-typescript-vue-plugin).

## Type Support for `.vue` Imports in TS

TypeScript cannot handle type information for `.vue` imports by default, so we replace the `tsc` CLI with `vue-tsc` for type checking. In editors, we need [TypeScript Vue Plugin (Volar)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.vscode-typescript-vue-plugin) to make the TypeScript language service aware of `.vue` types.

If the standalone TypeScript plugin doesn't feel fast enough to you, Volar has also implemented a [Take Over Mode](https://github.com/johnsoncodehk/volar/discussions/471#discussioncomment-1361669) that is more performant. You can enable it by the following steps:

1. Disable the built-in TypeScript Extension
   1. Run `Extensions: Show Built-in Extensions` from VSCode's command palette
   2. Find `TypeScript and JavaScript Language Features`, right click and select `Disable (Workspace)`
2. Reload the VSCode window by running `Developer: Reload Window` from the command palette.
